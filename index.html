    <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-webhooks#creating-a-repository-webhook" target="_blank">Refer to this link to learn how to create a GitHub Webhook.</a></li>

    <h3>Jira</h3>
    <h4>1. Custom Issue Type:</h4>
    <li>Issue types distinguish different types of work in unique ways, and help you identify, categorize, and report on your teamâ€™s work across your Jira site. They can help your team build more structure into your working process.</li>
    <li>To understand more on <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/what-are-issue-types/">issue-types.</a></li>
    <li>Issue type name: Approvals</li>
    <li>Description: Approvals represents the GitHub Pull Request approval. This issue type will be for Project Managers/Approvers who are managing the GitHub Project outside of GitHub. An external approval taken from JIRA.</li>
    <h5>a. Fields:</h5>
        <li><strong>Description fields:</strong> These fields describe the work that needs to be done. They display prominently in most views.</li>
        <li><strong>Summary [Required]:</strong> This is a mandatory field that provides a concise and clear overview of the issue. Ideally, it should be 255 characters or less for optimal readability. Think of it as a headline that captures the essence of the problem or task.</li>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> This optional field allows for a more detailed explanation of the issue. Describe the symptoms, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and any other relevant information that helps understand the problem and how to resolve it.</li>
    <h5>b. Context Fields:</h5><p>These fields provide context to the work, and help group, filter, and report on similar issues.</p>
        <li><strong>Assignee:</strong> This field indicates the person responsible for working on the issue. Selecting an assignee improves accountability and helps track progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Labels:</strong> These user-defined keywords categorize issues for better organization and filtering. Use them to group related issues or indicate priority levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Parent:</strong> This field links the current issue to another related issue, often called a "subtask" or a "dependent issue." It helps clarify hierarchical relationships and dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Pull_Request_Number [Required]:</strong> This custom field stores the unique identifier of the associated pull request in GitHub.</li>
      <h5>c. Reporter:</h5><p>This field shows the user who initially created the issue. It provides an audit trail and helps identify who raised the concern. This field is hidden when its empty.</p>

    <h4>2. Custom issue field:</h4>
        <li>In the above issue type, we have a context issue, 'Pull_Request_Number'. This is a custom issue type created to extract the pull request number from GitHub.</li>
        <li>Here, I am using it to extract the PR number data from GitHub using Webhook data.</li>
        <li>Refer to <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/create-a-custom-field/">Create a custom issue field</a> to set up one in your JIRA project.</li>
    <h4>3. Automation rules:</h4>
        <p><strong>Rule 1: PM-Approval-in-JIRA</strong></p>
        <li>Trigger: GitHub Incoming webhook <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request">Pull_request</a> event. This rule is triggerd whenever a Pull request activity occurs in GitHub.</li>
        <li>Action 1: As soon as the rule is triggered, a log action is captured to display the Pull_request activities. For instance, Pull request assigned, auto merge disabled, auto merge enabled, closed, converted to draft, demilestoned, dequeued, edited, enqueued, labeled, locked, milestoned, opened, ready for review, reopened, review request removed, review requested, synchronized, unassigned, unlabeled, or unlocked.</li>
        <li>IF condition: We set a condition to proceed further, only if the Pull_request activity is "opened".</li>
        <li>Action 2: This action will 'Create an issue', whenever PR is opened:</li>
          <li>Project: Specify the project name.</li>
          <li>Issue type: Approvals</li>
          <li>Choose a field to set: Assignee, Description</li>
          <li>Summary* [required]:
            <div class="code-box1" id="codeBox1">
              <code id="codeSnippet1">Pull Request#{{webhookData.number}} for {{webhookData.repository.name}}</code>
              <button class="copy-button1" onclick="CodeCopy.copyCode('codeSnippet1')">Copy Code</button>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>The above expression will create an issue in JIRA with a title that includes information about a specific GitHub pull request. The placeholders like {{webhookData.number}} and {{webhookData.repository.name}} will be dynamically replaced with actual data from the webhook payload when the automation rule is executed.</li>
        <li>Description: </li>
        <div class="code-box2" id="codeBox2">
          <code id="codeSnippet2">
            {{webhookData.pull_request.user.login}} has created Pull Request
            #{{webhookData.number}} for {{webhookData.repository.name}}
            Link to Pull request {{webhookData.pull_request.html_url}}
            {{webhookData.pull_request.body}}
          </code>
          <button class="copy-button2" onclick="CodeCopy.copyCode('codeSnippet2')">Copy Code</button>
